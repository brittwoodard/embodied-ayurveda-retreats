    <h1 class="serif-lg text-center mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We respect your privacy and understand how important it is to feel secure when sharing your personal information
        online. We collect only the necessary information to enhance your experience with us—whether you're visiting our
        site, signing up for a retreat, or simply exploring what we offer.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">What information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>When you interact with us—whether through registering, purchasing, or simply browsing—we may ask for details like
        your name, email address, or phone number. This helps us provide personalized service and tailor our offerings
        to what you're most interested in.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">When do we collect it?</h2>
    <p>We gather information when you fill out a form, sign up for a course, or interact with us in other ways on our
        site.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">How do we use your information?</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personalize your experience, ensuring you're seeing content and offers that resonate with you</li>
        <li>Improve customer service and address any inquiries you may have</li>

    </ul>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">Your security</h2>
    <p>While we don’t ask for credit card numbers and focus primarily on providing helpful content and resources, we do
        scan for malware regularly to keep your browsing experience safe.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">Cookies</h2>
    <p>Like most websites, we use cookies to understand your preferences and make your experience smoother each time you
        visit. You can choose to adjust your browser settings to limit cookies if you prefer, but some features of our
        site may not work as efficiently without them.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">Third-party sharing</h2>
    <p>We don’t sell or trade your personal information. Trusted partners who help us operate our website or assist with
        business operations may have access to it, but only if they agree to keep it confidential.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">Third-party links</h2>
    <p>We don't include third-party products or services on our site.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">Google and tracking</h2>
    <p>While we haven’t enabled Google AdSense, we may in the future. We respect “Do Not Track” signals and avoid
        third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">COPPA</h2>
    <p>We don’t target or market to children under 13, in line with COPPA guidelines.</p>
