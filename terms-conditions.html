    <h1 class="serif-lg text-center mb-4">Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">1.0 Payments & Cancellations</h2>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.1 Terms of Service</h3>
    <p>Airfares, airport transfers, in-transit accommodation, visas, airport taxes, travel insurance, and alcohol are
        not included in the cost of the Bali Preceptor Experience unless otherwise specified.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.2 Reservations</h3>
    <p>To reserve your place on the Bali Preceptor Experience, you must complete the payment form and pay the required
        deposit. A reservation is only confirmed once the deposit has been received.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.3 Payment & Acceptance of Terms and Conditions</h3>
    <p>By making any payment—whether partial or full—you agree to the terms and conditions outlined herein. A signature
        is not required to indicate acceptance of these terms, although it is required for the video release waiver
        form. Final balances are due 30 days before the start date of the Bali Preceptor Experience. If the final
        payment is not received by this date, Brittany Woodard reserves the right to cancel your reservation and offer
        your spot to another participant. In this case, any payments made will be forfeited.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.4 Cancellation by Guest & Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>We understand that plans can change, but due to the nature of our preparations, we employ a strict No Refund
        Policy for the $500 deposit, which is non-refundable and non-transferable. If you need to cancel your
        participation, please notify Brittany Woodard by email at connect@embodiedayurvedaretreats.com. Once your
        cancellation notice is received, it will take effect. If you cancel before October 25, 2024, you will be
        eligible for a refund, excluding the $500 deposit. After October 25, 2024, no refunds will be issued under any
        circumstances.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.5 Cancellation by Brittany Woodard</h3>
    <p>While we make every effort to ensure the Bali Preceptor Experience runs as planned, there may be instances beyond
        our control (natural disasters, illness, civil unrest, insufficient number of participants, etc.) that require
        cancellation. In such cases, participants may transfer their deposit to a future Preceptor Experience organized
        by Brittany Woodard within 12 months. Brittany Woodard will not be liable for any refunds or reimbursements.
        Participants are strongly advised to take out comprehensive travel insurance to protect against potential losses
        due to such events.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.6 Changes by Brittany Woodard</h3>
    <p>While we strive to maintain consistency in our program, unforeseen circumstances may necessitate changes to the
        Bali Preceptor Experience, including but not limited to venue, teachers, itinerary, or other aspects of the
        experience. Brittany Woodard will not be responsible for reimbursing or refunding any payments if participants
        decide to cancel based on these changes. It is the participant’s responsibility to ensure their travel insurance
        covers such eventualities. Additional costs related to these changes, including but not limited to visa,
        passport, vaccination, gear purchases, and taxes, will not be reimbursed by Brittany Woodard.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.7 Disrupted Travel</h3>
    <p>It is the participant’s responsibility to ensure they have a valid passport (with at least 6 months’ validity
        after the intended return date) and the necessary visas for travel. Brittany Woodard is not liable for any
        disruptions to travel resulting from issues with passports or visas. Participants should handle these matters
        before traveling to the retreat.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.8 Participant Minimum Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>The Bali Preceptor Experience requires a minimum of 7 participants to proceed, ensuring the program’s viability
        and quality. Participants are strongly advised to wait for confirmation from Brittany Woodard that the minimum
        participant number has been reached before booking flights or making significant travel arrangements. We
        recommend selecting travel insurance that covers potential cancellations or disruptions. Brittany Woodard’s goal
        is to maintain transparency and provide timely updates to allow participants sufficient time to plan and make
        necessary adjustments.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">1.9 Chargeback Policy</h3>
    <p>A chargeback occurs when a credit card holder disputes a charge with their bank, which can reverse a previously
        processed transaction. If a participant initiates a chargeback, they will be immediately removed from the Bali
        Preceptor Experience and will not be eligible for any form of refund, including both full payments and
        installment payments made prior to the chargeback.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">2.0 Insurance & documentation</h2>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">2.1 Travel Insurance</h3>
    <p>Travel insurance is mandatory for all participants of the Bali Preceptor Experience and must cover the retreat’s
        dates and location, including medical and natural disaster coverage. We highly recommend adding a 'Cancel for
        Any Reason' option to your policy for additional protection. This will help recover costs in case of unexpected
        events, personal cancellations, or if Brittany Woodard cancels the retreat for any reason. Standard travel
        insurance usually covers illness or injury but may not cover other reasons for cancellation.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">2.2 Travel Documents & Immunizations</h3>
    <p>Each participant is responsible for obtaining all required travel documents, including visas unless otherwise
        noted. Information on required documentation will be provided on our website or upon request. Participants are
        also responsible for obtaining any necessary immunizations. Please consult your local travel clinic for the
        latest requirements.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">3.0 Acknowledgement</h2>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">3.1 Acknowledgement of Risks & Assumption of Responsibility</h3>
    <p>While Brittany Woodard takes reasonable measures to ensure participant safety, the Bali Preceptor Experience
        involves inherent risks that participants must acknowledge. These risks may include injury, illness, or property
        loss, especially given the retreat’s location in Ubud, Bali, which may be hours away from medical facilities due
        to traffic or other factors. Activities may include but are not limited to yoga, dance, massage, herbal
        preparation, eating, and driving. Environmental risks, such as extreme weather, flash floods, wildlife
        encounters, or other natural occurrences, may also arise.
        Participation is entirely voluntary, and by joining the Bali Preceptor Experience, participants agree to assume
        full responsibility for any risks associated with the program. Brittany Woodard will not be liable for any
        injury, delay, or damage caused by unforeseen environmental factors or other forces of nature.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">4.0 Waiver</h2>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">4.1 Release & Waiver of Liability</h3>
    <p>By accepting these terms, participants declare they have no medical conditions that would prevent them from
        safely participating in the Bali Preceptor Experience. Participants voluntarily assume all risks related to the
        retreat and release Brittany Woodard and her team from any liability for personal injury, illness, property
        damage, or emotional distress incurred during the Bali Preceptor Experience.</p>
    <p>Participants also agree that Brittany Woodard reserves the right to remove any participant from the retreat if
        their behavior is disruptive or negatively impacts the group. Participants removed from the program for any
        reason will forfeit all payments made and will not be eligible for a refund.</p>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">4.2 Release & Permission to Photograph and Video</h3>
    <p>By agreeing to these terms, participants grant Brittany Woodard and Dr. Resmi V. Rajagopal permission to use
        their image, video, or likeness for promotional purposes, including on social media, websites, and in
        promotional materials. Participants waive the right to inspect or approve any finished products where their
        likeness appears and will not receive compensation for any use of these materials. Images and videos may be used
        in a variety of commercial settings, including online platforms and broadcast media.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">5.0 Code of Conduct</h2>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">5.1 Conduct Policy</h3>
    <p>Our conduct policy upholds the highest standards of respect, inclusivity, and cultural sensitivity. All
        participants are expected to respect individual differences in race, culture, religion, gender identity, and
        sexual orientation. Discrimination or disrespect in any form will not be tolerated.</p>
    <p>As guests in Bali, participants are required to respect local customs, traditions, and people, behaving
        courteously and following local etiquette. Professionalism is essential, and participants are expected to act
        responsibly in all interactions with fellow participants, preceptors, and clients. This includes being punctual,
        adhering to program guidelines and schedules, and maintaining a respectful attitude throughout the retreat.</p>
    <p>We enforce a zero-tolerance policy for any form of harassment, bullying, or discrimination. Violations of this
        policy will result in immediate removal from the program without eligibility for a refund. Additionally,
        participants must comply with all local laws and regulations. Any involvement in illegal activities will result
        in dismissal from the program.</p>
    <p>Finally, participants are encouraged to be mindful of their environmental impact and contribute positively to the
        community of Ubud, respecting the natural surroundings and local resources.</p>
    <h2 class="serif-sm mt-8">6.0 Force Majeur</h2>
    <h3 class="font-serif text-[1rem] mt-4">6.1 Force Majeure Clause</h3>
    <p>Brittany Woodard shall not be held liable for any failure to perform her obligations under these terms if such
        failure is due to circumstances beyond her control, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics,
        government restrictions, civil unrest, or other Force Majeure events. In such cases, participants may transfer
        their deposits to a future retreat or claim reimbursement through their travel insurance provider.</p>
